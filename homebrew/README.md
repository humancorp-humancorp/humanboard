# Homebrew Tap Setup

To distribute Humanboard via Homebrew, create a separate repository for the tap.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the tap repository

Create a new GitHub repo named `homebrew-humanboard` under your account.

```bash
# Clone the new repo
git clone https://github.com/humancorp-humancorp/homebrew-humanboard.git
cd homebrew-humanboard

# Create the Casks directory
mkdir -p Casks

# Copy the cask formula
cp /path/to/humanboard/homebrew/humanboard.rb Casks/humanboard.rb

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add humanboard cask"
git push
```

### 2. Update the cask after each release

After creating a GitHub release, update `Casks/humanboard.rb` with:
- New `version` from the tag
- New `sha256` from the release notes (auto-generated by GitHub Actions)

### 3. Users install with

```bash
brew tap humancorp-humancorp/humanboard
brew install --cask humanboard
```

## Automating Updates (Optional)

You can automate cask updates by adding a GitHub Action to this repo that:
1. Triggers on new releases in the main humanboard repo
2. Updates the version and sha256
3. Commits and pushes

See: https://github.com/Homebrew/actions
